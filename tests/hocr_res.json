In our own day we are all familiar with the controversy so often re- newed, and always so fruitlessly waged, over the respective claims of two distinguished novelists. It is almost impossible in any general company to speak warmly of Dickens without arousing a counterblast in favour of Thackeray, or to mention the author of Vanity Fair without being instantly chal- lenged for a judgment upon the merits of Pickwick. The history of {{{English}}} painting offers an example of the same unlucky pre- dicament. In the art of the eighteenth century the names of Reynolds and Gains- borough are inseparably linked together, and the individual genius of these distinguished painters is nearly always appraised by an exhaustive process of comparison that some- times does less than justice to both. Nor is it altogether possible even at this time to escape from inveterate usage. In reality they were men of opposite temperament, very differently endowed by nature, and offering in their work the most striking con- trasts of system and style ; and yet so narrow was the world of art in which they moved, so little liberty of choice did it afford even to men of the highest eminence in their profession, that Reynolds and Gainsborough were forced into constant competition from the mere fact that they were continually engaged in a common employment.

From this time also there is no longer any doubt as to the particular branch\u2019 of art in which Gainsborough\u2019s reputation was destined to be made, A fashionable painter at Bath could be nothing else than a fashionable portrait painter. Nor need it be supposed that in finally devoting himself to portraiture Gainsborough did any violence to his own feelings. We have spoken of him as being before all things a lover of landscape, and the passion for the beauty of nature that was in him from the first remained strong enough to the end to allow him even among his many commissions to return again to his first love. And in truth, if we glance at the history of art we shall find that there is some natural alliance between the two pursuits, and that they have again and again been practised together. In our own time we have an in- stance of a great portrait painter, who is also a keen student of outward nature, and when landscape first emerged as a separate and distinct department of art it was under the guidance of a genius who was also famous in portrait. Of the modern feeling for land- seape Titian may be said to have been the discoverer, and from his time onwards it constantly became an alternative study with men whose principal function in art was the interpretation of human character. We may cite the eminent examples of Rubens and Rembrandt ; and even of Vandyck we have evidence in his drawings that he might under different conditions have left his mark in this department of art. There was there- fore no good reason why Gainsborough should not have divided his energies between por- trait and landscape, gaining equal fame in both. It was the taste of his time rather than the genius cf the artist which deter- mined that he should concern himself mainly with the former, and it is a convincing proof of the painter\u2019s loyal devotion to nature that, despite the comparative indifference with which his work in this kind was regarded, he should nevertheless have accomplished enough to fix his rank as in some sense the founder of the {{{English}}} school of landscape.

Gainsborough\u2019s manner, in short, was the outcome of his own individu- ality, and if he changed or modified the actual truths presented to him it was with the design of fixing upon the canvas a purely personal impression of the chosen scene. Wilson, on the other hand, worked in obedi- ence to certain settled principles of classical style. His genius shines through the con- ventions of his art, but the conventions exist nevertheless, and it is obvious in all his work that he had no desire to cast them aside ; rather, it may be said, he treated them with reverence, and sought to preserve them from attack. It follows, therefore, that however admirable his art, it was little calculated to inspire a school or to open a wider field to the student of nature. Later {{{English}}} landscape art owes to him little more than the example of a sincere spirit finely trained according to a long-accepted concep- tion of beauty and style ; whereas to Gains- borough, on the other hand, our landscape- painters may almost be said to owe their liberty. And this fact was indeed recognised at the time, though in terms not always favourable to the painter\u2019s genius. When Reynolds says of him that he gave \u201ca faith- ful if not a poetical representation of what he had before him,\u201d we know what he means because we know in what at that day the poetical element in art was held to consist. Looking back at Gainshorough\u2019s work now, it would seem rather to be open to the oppo- site reproach. Its limitation, to our later sense, seems to lie not on the side of poetry but of fidelity, and the criticism which it excites is that in obedience to an imaginative impulse he handled nature too freely, and paid too little regard to the absolute. If, for instance, we compare Gainsborough\u2019s studies of rustic character and peasant life with the work of an artist like Jean Francois Millet, they appear rather fanciful creations than veracious portraits. And so indeed they are, for the time had not yet come when art could hope to win the deeper kind of beauty which has grown out of a profounder know- ledge of the actual life of the toilers in the fields, Despite their picturesque rags, Gains- borough\u2019s peasant people are for the most part only playing at poverty. They fill their place in the landscape with a pleasing grace that sorts with the scheme of the picture, but they scarcely convince us of their reality.

To his unquestioned eminence as a landscape-painter Reynolds had already long before borne testimony, and it was on one occasion when he was speaking of his dead rival as the greatest landscape-painter of his age, that Wilson was heard to mutter, \u201c Ay, and the greatest portrait-painter too.\u201d That opinion; however, has not yet received confirmation.
